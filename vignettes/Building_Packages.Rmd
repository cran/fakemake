__There's a more elaborated vignette coming with package `packager`. Please see 
[packager's vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/package=packager/vignettes/An_Introduction_to_packager.html).__


## Creating the Package
First, we need to create a sample package, so we create a package skeleton:
``` {r create_package, results = "hide", message = FALSE}
pkg_path <- file.path(tempdir(), "fakepack")
unlink(pkg_path, force = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
usethis::create_package(pkg_path)
```

And add a minimal R code file:

``` {r}
file.copy(system.file("templates", "throw.R", package = "fakemake"),
          file.path(pkg_path, "R"))
```

This package does not make any sense. It is just a minimal working example 
(in the sense that it passes `R CMD build` and a simple `R CMD check`). 
It does not provide any functionality apart from a single internal function
that is not exported via the package's NAMESPACE. 
It is just there to exemplify the usage of *fakemake*.


## Setting Up the Makelist
Then we get a package makelist:

``` {r}
ml <-  fakemake::provide_make_list("vignette")
```

And we have a look at it:
``` {r,fig.width = 6.8, fig.height = 6.8}
withr::with_dir(pkg_path, fakemake::visualize(ml))
```

Obviously the tarball depends on many files and the only target that's no other
target's prerequisite is "log/check.Rout".
If you are more into hierarchical depictions, you can use the terminal target as
root:

``` {r,fig.width = 6.8, fig.height = 6.8}
withr::with_dir(pkg_path, fakemake::visualize(ml, root = "log/check.Rout"))
```

But then you might be interested in
[this python program](https://github.com/lindenb/makefile2graph),
it would leave with this graph:
![makefile2graph output](makefile2graph.png)

I regularly use it to visualize complex Makefiles.


### More on Target Rules
Let's take a look at the target rule that builds the tarball:
``` {r}
index <- which(sapply(ml, function(x) x["alias"] == "build"))
ml[[index]]
```
Note that some of its items are strings giving file names, some are 
strings that parse as R expressions, and `prerequisites` is a mix of both. 
Obviously, *fakemake* parses and evaluates these character strings dynamically. 

Let us take a look at the prerequisites for `roxygen2`:
``` {r}
index <- which(sapply(ml, function(x) x["alias"] == "roxygen2"))
ml[[index]][["prerequisites"]]
```

## Building the Package

Now we build and check the package in one go:
``` {r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
withr::with_dir(pkg_path, print(fakemake::make("check", ml)))

```

We should now detach the package to prevent the coverage target to crash in 
subsequent calls.
``` {r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
if ("fakepack" %in% .packages()) detach("package:fakepack", unload = TRUE)

```

We see the files created in the log directory correspond to the names given by 
*make*:

``` {r}
list.files(file.path(pkg_path, "log"))
```

and we can take a look at one:
``` {r}
cat(readLines(file.path(pkg_path, "log", "check.Rout")), sep = "\n")
```


Rebuilding the package does not do anything (NULL is returned instead of the
                                             names of targets above), you save
quite some CPU time compared to unconditionally rerunning the codes in the 
makelist:

``` {r}
system.time(suppressMessages(withr::with_dir(pkg_path,
                                             print(fakemake::make("check",
                                                                  ml)))))
```

## Changing Files and Rebuilding the Package
Let us take a look at our testing coverage:

``` {r}
cat(readLines(file.path(pkg_path, "log", "covr.Rout")), sep = "\n")
```

Well, poor. So we add a test file:

``` {r}
dir.create(file.path(pkg_path, "tests", "testthat"), recursive = TRUE)
file.copy(system.file("templates", "testthat.R", package = "fakemake"),
          file.path(pkg_path, "tests"))
file.copy(system.file("templates", "test-throw.R", package = "fakemake"),
          file.path(pkg_path, "tests", "testthat"))

```


``` {r,fig.width = 6.8, fig.height = 6.8}
withr::with_dir(pkg_path, fakemake::visualize(ml))
```


Now we re-build the package's tarball again (of course we could 
`make("check", ml)` again, but for the sake of (CRAN's) CPU time, 
                                                I skip the check):
``` {r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
withr::with_dir(pkg_path, print(fakemake::make("build", ml)))
```

We see that most of the build chain is rerun, except *roxygenising*, since the
files under "tests/" are not prerequisites to *log/royxgen2.Rout*.
Ah, and the test coverage is improved:
``` {r}
cat(readLines(file.path(pkg_path, "log", "covr.Rout")), sep = "\n")
```
